title: Running Effects
description: Explore various "run" functions in the Effect module to execute effects. Learn about `runSync` for synchronous execution, `runSyncExit` for obtaining results as `Exit`, `runPromise` for executing with a Promise result, and `runPromiseExit` for Promise results with `Exit`. Understand their use cases and considerations. Check out a cheatsheet summarizing available functions for executing effects in different contexts.

To execute an `Effect`, we can utilize a variety of "run" functions provided by the `Effect` module.

<Aside type="tip">
  The recommended approach is to design your program with the majority of its
  logic as Effects. It's advisable to use the `run*` functions closer to the
  "edge" of your program. This approach allows for greater flexibility in
  executing your program and building sophisticated Effects.
</Aside>

## runSync

The `Effect.runSync` function is used to execute an Effect synchronously, which means it runs immediately and returns the result.

```ts file=<rootDir>/running-effects/runSync.ts

```

`Effect.runSync` will throw an error if your Effect fails or performs any
asynchronous tasks. In the latter case, the execution will not proceed
beyond that asynchronous task.

```ts file=<rootDir>/running-effects/runSync-caution.ts

```

## runSyncExit

The `Effect.runSyncExit` function is used to execute an Effect synchronously, which means it runs immediately and returns the result as an [Exit](/data-types/exit)
(a data type used to describe the result of executing an `Effect` workflow).

```ts file=<rootDir>/running-effects/runSyncExit.ts

```

`Effect.runSyncExit` will throw an error if your Effect performs any
asynchronous tasks and the execution will not proceed beyond that
asynchronous task.

```ts file=<rootDir>/running-effects/runSyncExit-caution.ts

```

## runPromise

The `Effect.runPromise` function is used to execute an Effect and obtain the result as a `Promise`.

```ts file=<rootDir>/running-effects/runPromise.ts

```

`Effect.runPromise` will reject with an error if your Effect fails

```ts file=<rootDir>/running-effects/runPromise-caution.ts

```

## runPromiseExit

The `Effect.runPromiseExit` function is used to execute an Effect and obtain the result as a `Promise` that resolves to an [Exit](/data-types/exit)
(a data type used to describe the result of executing an `Effect` workflow).

```ts file=<rootDir>/running-effects/runPromiseExit.ts

```

## runFork

The `Effect.runFork` function serves as a foundational building block for running effects. In fact, all other run functions are built upon it. Unless you have a specific need for a Promise or a synchronous operation, `Effect.runFork` is the recommended choice. It returns a fiber that you can observe or interrupt as needed.

```ts file=<rootDir>/running-effects/runFork.ts

```

In this example, the `program` continuously logs "running..." with each repetition spaced 200 milliseconds apart. You can learn more about repetitions and scheduling in our [Introduction to Scheduling](/scheduling/introduction) guide.

To stop the execution of the program, we use `Fiber.interrupt` on the fiber returned by `Effect.runFork`. This allows you to control the execution flow and terminate it when necessary.

For a deeper understanding of how fibers work and how to handle interruptions, check out our guides on [Fibers](/concurrency/fibers) and [Interruptions](/concurrency/interruption-model).

## Cheatsheet

The table provides a summary of the available `run*` functions, along with their input and output types, allowing you to choose the appropriate function based on your needs.

| **API**          | **Given**      | **To**                |
| ---------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| `runSync`        | `Effect<A, E>` | `A`                   |
| `runSyncExit`    | `Effect<A, E>` | `Exit<A, E>`          |
| `runPromise`     | `Effect<A, E>` | `Promise<A>`          |
| `runPromiseExit` | `Effect<A, E>` | `Promise<Exit<A, E>>` |
| `runFork`        | `Effect<A, E>` | `RuntimeFiber<A, E>`  |
