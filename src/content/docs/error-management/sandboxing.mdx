Errors are a common part of programming, and they can happen for various reasons, such as failures, defects, fiber interruptions, or even a combination of these factors. In this guide, we'll explore how to use the `Effect.sandbox` function to isolate and understand the causes of errors in your code.

## sandbox / unsandbox

The `Effect.sandbox` function allows you to encapsulate all the potential causes of an error in an effect. It exposes the full cause of an effect, whether it's due to a failure, defect, fiber interruption, or a combination of these factors.

Here's the signature of the `Effect.sandbox` function:

```ts showLineNumbers=false
Effect<A, E, R> -> Effect<A, Cause<E>, R>
```

In simple terms, it takes an effect `Effect<A, E, R>` and transforms it into an effect `Effect<A, Cause<E>, R>` where the error channel now contains a detailed cause of the error.

By using the `Effect.sandbox` function, you gain access to the underlying causes of exceptional effects. These causes are represented as a type of `Cause<E>` and are available in the error channel of the `Effect` data type.

Once you have exposed the causes, you can utilize standard error-handling operators like [Effect.catchAll](/error-management/expected-errors#catchall) and [Effect.catchTags](/error-management/expected-errors#catchtags) to handle errors more effectively. These operators allow you to respond to specific error conditions.

**Example**

```ts twoslash file=<rootDir>/sandboxing/sandbox.ts

```

In this example, we expose the full cause of an effect using `Effect.sandbox`. Then, we handle specific error conditions using `Effect.catchTags`. Finally, if needed, we can undo the sandboxing operation with `Effect.unsandbox`.
