In the `Effect` data type, just like other data types such as [Option](/data-types/option#matching) and [Exit](/data-types/exit#matching), we have a `match` function that allows us to handle different cases simultaneously. When working with effects, we also have several functions that enable us to handle both success and failure scenarios.

## match

The `Effect.match` function allows us to handle both success and failure cases in a non-effectful manner by providing a handler for each case.

**Example**

```ts file=<rootDir>/matching/match.ts

```

## ignore

We can choose to ignore the success and failure values if we're not interested in them:

```ts file=<rootDir>/matching/match-ignore.ts

```

In this case, we use the `constVoid` function from the `Function` module, which constantly returns `void`, to provide handlers that perform no operation. This effectively discards the success and failure values and focuses solely on the control flow or side effects of the program.

Alternatively, we can achieve the same result using the `Effect.ignore` function:

```ts file=<rootDir>/matching/ignore.ts

```

## matchEffect

In addition to `Effect.match`, we have the `Effect.matchEffect` function, which allows us to handle success and failure cases while performing additional side effects.

**Example**

```ts file=<rootDir>/matching/matchEffect.ts

```

## matchCause / matchCauseEffect

Effect also provides `Effect.matchCause` and `Effect.matchCauseEffect` functions, which are useful for accessing the full cause of the underlying fiber in case of failure.
This allows us to handle different failure causes separately and take appropriate actions.

**Example: `matchCauseEffect`**

```ts file=<rootDir>/matching/matchCauseEffect.ts

```
