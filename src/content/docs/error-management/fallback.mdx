title: Fallback
description: Explore techniques for handling failures and fallbacks in Effect, including `orElse` to try alternate effects, `orElseFail` and `orElseSucceed` to modify failures, and `firstSuccessOf` to retrieve the result of the first successful effect. Learn how to gracefully handle errors and create fallback mechanisms in your Effect programs.

This page explains various techniques for handling failures and creating fallback mechanisms in the Effect library.

## orElse

We can attempt one effect, and if it fails, we can try another effect using the `Effect.orElse` function.

**Example**

```ts twoslash file=<rootDir>/fallback/orElse.ts

```

## orElseFail / orElseSucceed

These two operators modify the original failure by replacing it with constant succeed or failure values.

The `Effect.orElseFail` will always replace the original failure with the new one:

```ts twoslash file=<rootDir>/fallback/orElseFail.ts

```

The `Effect.orElseSucceed` function will always replace the original failure with a success value, so the resulting effect cannot fail:

```ts twoslash file=<rootDir>/fallback/orElseSucceed.ts

```

## firstSuccessOf

The `Effect.firstSuccessOf` function simplifies running a series of effects and returns the result of the first one that succeeds. If none of the effects succeed, the resulting effect will fail with the error of the last effect in the series.

**Example**

In the following example, we attempt to retrieve a configuration from different nodes.
If retrieving from the primary node fails, we successively try retrieving from the next available nodes until we find a successful result.

```ts twoslash file=<rootDir>/fallback/firstSuccessOf.ts

```

<Aside type="caution">
  If the collection provided to the `Effect.firstSuccessOf` function is
  empty, it will throw an `IllegalArgumentException` error.
