Yieldable Errors are special types of errors that can be yielded within a generator function used by [Effect.gen](/getting-started/using-generators).
The unique feature of these errors is that you don't need to use the [Effect.fail](/getting-started/creating-effects#fail) API explicitly to handle them.
They offer a more intuitive and convenient way to work with custom errors in your code.

## Data.Error

The `Data.Error` constructor enables you to create a base yieldable error class.
This class can be used to represent different types of errors in your code.

**Example:**

```ts file=<rootDir>/yieldable-errors/Data.Error.ts

```

## Data.TaggedError

The `Data.TaggedError` constructor is useful for creating tagged yieldable errors.
These errors bear a distinct property named `_tag`, which acts as their unique identifier, allowing you to differentiate them from one another.

**Example:**

```ts file=<rootDir>/yieldable-errors/Data.TaggedError.ts

```

In this example, we create `FooError` and `BarError` classes with distinct tags ("Foo" and "Bar"). These tags help identify the type of error when handling errors in your code.
