In a typical Effect application, when an error occurs, it usually fails with the first error encountered by the Effect runtime:

```ts file=<rootDir>/parallel-and-sequential-errors/first-error.ts

```

In this case, the program will fail with the first error, which is "Oh uh!":

## Parallel Errors

However, in some situations, you may encounter multiple errors, especially when performing parallel computations. When parallel computations are involved, the application may fail due to multiple errors:

```ts file=<rootDir>/parallel-and-sequential-errors/parallel-errors.ts

```

In this example, the program runs both `fail` and `die` concurrently, and if both fail, it will result in multiple errors.

### parallelErrors

Effect provides a useful function called `Effect.parallelErrors` that exposes all parallel failure errors in the error channel.

**Example**

```ts file=<rootDir>/parallel-and-sequential-errors/parallelErrors.ts

```

In this example, `Effect.parallelErrors` combines the errors from `fail1` and `fail2` into a single error.

## Sequential Errors

When working with resource-safety operators like `Effect.ensuring`, you may encounter multiple sequential errors.
This happens because regardless of whether the original effect has any errors or not, the finalizer is uninterruptible and will run:

```ts file=<rootDir>/parallel-and-sequential-errors/sequential-errors.ts

```

In this case, the program will result in multiple sequential errors if both `fail` and the finalizer `die` encounter errors.
