The `Effect` type represents an **immutable** value that **lazily** describes a workflow or job:

```ts showLineNumbers=false
Effect<Success, Error, Requirements>
```

This type encapsulates the logic of a program, defining whether it succeeds, providing a value of type `Success`, or fails, resulting in an error of type `Error`. Additionally, the program requires a collection of contextual data `Context<Requirements>` to execute.

Conceptually, you can think of `Effect` as an effectful version of the following function type:

```ts showLineNumbers=false
type Effect<Success, Error, Requirements> = (
  context: Context<Requirements>
) => Error | Success
```

However, effects are not actually functions. They can model synchronous, asynchronous, concurrent, and resourceful computations.

## Type Parameters

The `Effect` type has three type parameters with the following meanings:

| Parameter        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Success**      | Represents the type of value that an effect can succeed with when executed. If this type parameter is `void`, it means the effect produces no useful information, while if it is `never`, it means the effect runs forever (or until failure). |
| **Error**        | Represents the expected errors that can occur when executing an effect. If this type parameter is `never`, it means the effect cannot fail, because there are no values of type `never`.                                                       |
| **Requirements** | Represents the contextual data required by the effect to be executed. This data is stored in a collection named `Context`. If this type parameter is `never`, it means the effect has no requirements and the `Context` collection is empty.   |

<Aside type="note" title="Type Parameter Abbreviations">
  In the Effect ecosystem, you may often encounter the type parameters of
  `Effect` abbreviated as `A`, `E`, and `R` respectively. This is just
  shorthand for the success value of type **A**, **E**rror, and
  **R**equirements.

## Understanding Effect Values and Their Execution

**Immutability**. `Effect` values are immutable, and every function in the Effect library produces a new `Effect` value.

**Modeling Interactions**. These values do not perform any actions themselves, they simply model or describe effectful interactions.

**Execution**. An `Effect` can be executed by the [Effect Runtime System](/docs/runtime/), which interprets it into actual interactions with the external world.
Ideally, this execution happens at a single entry point in your application, such as the main function where effectful operations are initiated.
