description: Explore various "run" functions in the Effect module to execute effects. Learn about `runSync` for synchronous execution, `runSyncExit` for obtaining results as `Exit`, `runPromise` for executing with a Promise result, and `runPromiseExit` for Promise results with `Exit`.

To execute an effect, we can utilize a variety of "run" functions provided by the `Effect` module.

<Aside type="tip">
  The recommended approach is to design your program with the majority of
  its logic as Effects. It's advisable to use the `run*` functions closer
  to the "edge" of your program. This approach allows for greater
  flexibility in executing your program and building sophisticated
  Effects.
</Aside>

## runSync

The `Effect.runSync` function is used to execute an effect synchronously, which means it runs immediately and returns the result.

**Example**

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

const program = Effect.sync(() => {
  console.log("Hello, World!")
  return 1
})

const result = Effect.runSync(program)
// Output: Hello, World!

console.log(result)
// Output: 1
```

The `Effect.runSync` function will throw an error if your effect fails or performs any
asynchronous tasks. In the latter case, the execution will not proceed
beyond that asynchronous task:

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

Effect.runSync(Effect.fail("my error")) // throws

Effect.runSync(Effect.promise(() => Promise.resolve(1))) // throws
```

## runSyncExit

The `Effect.runSyncExit` function is used to execute an effect synchronously, which means it runs immediately and returns the result as an [Exit](/docs/data-types/exit/)
(a data type used to describe the result of executing an effect workflow).

**Example**

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

const result1 = Effect.runSyncExit(Effect.succeed(1))
console.log(result1)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Exit",
  _tag: "Success",
  value: 1
}
*/

const result2 = Effect.runSyncExit(Effect.fail("my error"))
console.log(result2)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Exit",
  _tag: "Failure",
  cause: {
    _id: "Cause",
    _tag: "Fail",
    failure: "my error"
  }
}
*/
```

The `Effect.runSyncExit` function will throw an error if your effect performs any
asynchronous tasks and the execution will not proceed beyond that
asynchronous task:

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

Effect.runSyncExit(Effect.promise(() => Promise.resolve(1))) // throws
```

## runPromise

The `Effect.runPromise` function is used to execute an effect and obtain the result as a `Promise`.

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

Effect.runPromise(Effect.succeed(1)).then(console.log) // Output: 1
```

The `Effect.runPromise` function will reject with an error if your Effect fails:

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

Effect.runPromise(Effect.fail("my error")) // rejects
```

## runPromiseExit

The `Effect.runPromiseExit` function is used to execute an Effect and obtain the result as a `Promise` that resolves to an [Exit](/docs/data-types/exit/)
(a data type used to describe the result of executing an `Effect` workflow).

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

Effect.runPromiseExit(Effect.succeed(1)).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Exit",
  _tag: "Success",
  value: 1
}
*/

Effect.runPromiseExit(Effect.fail("my error")).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Exit",
  _tag: "Failure",
  cause: {
    _id: "Cause",
    _tag: "Fail",
    failure: "my error"
  }
}
*/
```

## runFork

The `Effect.runFork` function serves as a foundational building block for running effects. In fact, all other run functions are built upon it. Unless you have a specific need for a `Promise` or a synchronous operation, `Effect.runFork` is the recommended choice. It returns a fiber that you can observe or interrupt as needed.

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Console, Schedule, Fiber } from "effect"

const program = Effect.repeat(
  Console.log("running..."),
  Schedule.spaced("200 millis")
)

const fiber = Effect.runFork(program)

setTimeout(() => {
  Effect.runFork(Fiber.interrupt(fiber))
}, 500)
```

In this example, the `program` continuously logs "running..." with each repetition spaced 200 milliseconds apart. You can learn more about repetitions and scheduling in our [Introduction to Scheduling](/docs/scheduling/introduction/) guide.

To stop the execution of the program, we use `Fiber.interrupt` on the fiber returned by `Effect.runFork`. This allows you to control the execution flow and terminate it when necessary.

For a deeper understanding of how fibers work and how to handle interruptions, check out our guides on [Fibers](/docs/concurrency/fibers/) and [Interruptions](/docs/concurrency/interruption-model/).

## Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Effects

In the Effect library, there is no built-in way to determine in advance whether an effect will execute synchronously or asynchronously. While this idea was considered in earlier versions of Effect, it was ultimately not implemented for a few important reasons:

1. **Complexity:** Introducing this feature to track sync/async behavior in the type system would make Effect more complex to use and limit its composability.

2. **Safety Concerns:** We experimented with different approaches to track asynchronous Effects, but they all resulted in a worse developer experience without significantly improving safety. Even with fully synchronous types, we needed to support a `fromCallback` combinator to work with APIs using Continuation-Passing Style (CPS). However, at the type level, it's impossible to guarantee that such a function is always called immediately and not deferred.

### Best Practices for Running Effects

In most cases, effects are run at the outermost parts of your application. Typically, an application built around Effect will involve a single call to the main effect. Hereâ€™s how you should approach effect execution:

- Use `runPromise` or `runFork`: For most cases, asynchronous execution should be the default. These methods provide the best way to handle Effect-based workflows.

- Use `runSync` only when necessary: Synchronous execution should be considered an edge case, used only in scenarios where asynchronous execution is not feasible. For example, when you are sure the effect is purely synchronous and need immediate results.

## Cheatsheet

The table provides a summary of the available `run*` functions, along with their input and output types, allowing you to choose the appropriate function based on your needs.

| **API**          | **Given**      | **To**                |
| ---------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| `runSync`        | `Effect<A, E>` | `A`                   |
| `runSyncExit`    | `Effect<A, E>` | `Exit<A, E>`          |
| `runPromise`     | `Effect<A, E>` | `Promise<A>`          |
| `runPromiseExit` | `Effect<A, E>` | `Promise<Exit<A, E>>` |
| `runFork`        | `Effect<A, E>` | `RuntimeFiber<A, E>`  |
